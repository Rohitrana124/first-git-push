The old man fell silent for a short while, and then he gazed at Yang Ye, “Should we help him?”

Yang Jian shook his head, “Let’s continue watching. Let’s see if he has the right to be the pioneer for our Yang Clan.”

Meanwhile, at the moment Qian Hu and Gu Xiu saw Yang Ye stomp apart the elder’s head, their expressions simultaneously became solemn.

At this moment, they felt a trace of fear.

As for Yang Xuan, her eyes drooped while she remained silent. No one knew what she was thinking.

“He’s got balls!” Yang Gu smiled, “Yang Ceng, that kid is really brave!”

The old man by his side, Yang Ceng, nodded, “He is. I just wonder if his strength can keep up with it!”

Yang Gu chuckled and gazed at Yang Ye, “Won’t we know soon?”

Meanwhile, at the moment Yang Ye stomped open the old man’s head, Yang Wuyan’s face had instantly turned gloomy, and a violent aura seeped out from him. Everywhere it passed, space rippled in its wake.

Yang Ye suddenly raised his leg and kicked the old man’s corpse, causing the latter to transform into a shadow that flew over to Yang Wuyan. After that, Yang Ye pointed his sword at Yang Wuyan and asked, “What do you want? I’ll keep you company to the end of it!”

Countless people gazed at Yang Wuyan!

What did he want?

He naturally wanted to kill Yang Ye!
